# Find Best Token

## Product URL

https://graph-client-react-query.vercel.app/

## What it does

You can find token which has high APY and enough liquidity.
<br>
<br>

## The problem it solves

There are a lot a lot tokens on public blockchain.
Even if APY is high on Compound, there is risk about liquidity.
(Not enough liquidity leads risk of the token price falling down.)
By this app, by using information from Compound and Uniswap,
you can find best token for you.

・Subgraph Studio (testing endpoint to compound v2 and uniswap v2)
<br>

This is very basic trial for me.
So, I use The graph sample project by folk.
I arranged code and implement.
<br>
<br>

## What's next for

By more complicated queries, I will build
usefull information app.
